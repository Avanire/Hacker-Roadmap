# Hacker Roadmap (Currently Building)

A detailed plan to become proficient in hacking and penetration testing.

To begin, we must establish some key factors. Are you aiming to obtain a certification or a Bachelor's degree in this field, or are you pursuing hacking purely as a hobby? This distinction will influence the specific steps you need to take.

#### Step 3: Practice Hands-On Challenges on Hack The Box (More Advance)
- **Objective:** Gain practical experience by solving real-world hacking challenges in an unguided environment.
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Register on Hack The Box platform.
  - [ ] Attempt beginner-friendly machines to apply the knowledge gained from TryHackMe.
  - [ ] Progress to more challenging machines as skills improve.
- **Explanation:** Hack The Box provides a platform for honing your skills through hands-on experience with realistic scenarios. Unlike TryHackMe, it doesn't offer guided pathways, which encourages independent problem-solving and critical thinking.



#### Step 4: Continuously Expand Knowledge and Skills
- **Objective:** Stay updated with the latest trends, techniques, and tools in the field of hacking.
- **Actions:**
  - Participate in online forums and communities (e.g., Reddit's r/hacking, Hack Forums) to engage with other hackers and learn from their experiences.
  - Follow security blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels to keep abreast of new developments and insights.
  - Regularly challenge yourself with new hacking tasks, puzzles, and CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions.
- **Explanation:** Hacking is a dynamic field, and continuous learning is essential to stay relevant and proficient. By actively engaging with the hacking community and exploring new challenges, you'll continue to refine your skills and expand your knowledge base.

#### Step 5: CTF / Bug Bounty
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions:**
  - Join online CTF platforms such as Hack The Box, OverTheWire, or picoCTF.
  - Participate in both beginner and advanced CTF challenges to apply your knowledge and problem-solving skills.
  - Collaborate with other participants or teams to tackle more complex challenges and learn from each other's approaches.
  - Analyze the solutions and write-ups of challenges you couldn't solve to understand different techniques and strategies.

- **Bug Bounty Programs:**
  - [ ] Register on bug bounty platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, or Synack.
  - Browse available programs and identify those aligned with your expertise and interests, such as web application testing, mobile application testing, or network penetration testing.
  - Ethically report security vulnerabilities you discover in the targets specified by bug bounty programs.
  - Follow the guidelines provided by each program regarding vulnerability disclosure, severity assessment, and reward eligibility.
  - Continuously monitor the platforms for new programs and updates, as well as feedback on your submissions.
